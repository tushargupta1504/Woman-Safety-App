# NAARI-RAKSHAK
This repository is created for MINI-PROJECT under my 3rd semester and named as "NAARI-RAKSHAK".
NAARI-RAKSHAK is an app created for safety of everyone but specially focused on womens .
The overall evaluation can be broken down into three major steps, each of which is described 
separately. 
In three major steps, evaluation describes the entire operation of the application: 
1. The first and most important step is to fill out the contact information in the application that has 
been created. Those contacts could include our relatives, friends, and the police. When the app is 
first installed on the smart phone, the above contact information should be provided. The 
information you provide will be saved by the application.
2. The second major step is to send GPS information (in the form of Co-ordinates or a URL that 
leads to the person's location, such as Google) to the registered contacts during dangerous 
situations or when the person needs to be rescued. This step is only performed when the 
application's rescue button is pressed. This step can only be completed when the device is 
connected to a proper mobile network and the device's location service is turned on (GPS).
3. The work done in sending the message containing the location URL to the registered contacts is 
the third major step. An SMS is sent to the registered contacts with the location of the person. 
As a result, the application can track the person's exact location in real time, which is the 
primary goal of the proposed system, and the person can be rescued.
